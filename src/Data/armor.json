      "description": "This armor, dated 1591, is a decorated example that falls into the category of plate armor. While arms and armor are commonly associated with warfare, they were, as in this case, also used in other contexts, including tournaments, for parades or ceremonial events. The displayed armor was designed for a particular type of tournament, the foot tournament, and protected the front and back of the torso, as well as the arms and the head."

      "description": "While body armor in medieval Europe was formed either by a short-sleeved mail shirt (byrnie), made up of interlocking iron rings, or a garment of overlapping scales of iron, bronze, or horn, the plate armor gradually replaced chain mail. Plate armor is a type of personal body armor made from bronze, iron, or steel plates. Depending on the purpose, be it for combat, a foot or an equestrian tournament, corresponding parts of the body were covered."

      "description": "Anton Pfeffenhauser (Peffenhauser, Pepfenhauser) (around 1527 – 1601) was trained by members of the Helmschmied family and became the foremost master plate armorer in Augsburg during the late 16th century. He made richly decorated luxury armor for the princes of his time, including Archduke Ferdinand II, whose tournament armor is preserved at Ambras Castle in Innsbruck, or for Duke Johann Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar. This </br><span class='module-content' data-href='3'>half armor</span>, created around 1570 and attributed to him is now in the art collections of the Veste Coburg. Pfeffenhausers armor mark shows a free-standing tripot, corresponding to his coat of arms. A copper votive panel from 1586 preserved in the Museo Correr (Venice) shows Plattner with three of his sons, as well as his master's mark in the coat of arms."

      "description": "The armor presented here is made of iron, steel, brass and leather straps. It measures 1,20m in height, 82 cm in width and 32 cm in depth. Pfeffenhauser finished the metal with a decorative technique called bluing. The bluing process entails repeated gentle heating of the sheet metal until the surface turns blue. Together with the ornamentation in gilded etching, Pfeffenhauser demonstrates the finesse of the craftsmanship in his workshop. <br/>He collaborated with the painter-engraver <a href='https://d-nb.info/gnd/135926157' target='_blanc'>“Jörg Sorg the Younger (around 1525–1603)”</a> and the goldsmith <a href='https://d-nb.info/gnd/137462336' target='_blanc'>“Jörg Sigman (around 1527–1601)”</a>. Preliminary drawings of Sorg's decorations 1548-63 are documented in the so-called <a href='https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/item/OLRY3TESGRMY2NMGHMZ3ZBBLWKPOPGEF' target='_blanc'>“Stuttgarter Harnisch-Musterbuch”</a>: 1548–1563 (Württemberg State Library, Cod.

      "description": "At the beginning of the 16th century armor decoration frequently features Christian saints, biblical figures, and classical figures, set in cartouches and arranged on the top of the breastplate or embedded in more abstract decorum (e.g. in this example <a href='https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1996.299' target='_blanc'>“in this example”</a>). The designs on Pfeffenhausers amor are characterized by lines and linear decorum. An early </br><span class='module-content' data-href='5'>Field and tournament armor</span> of Johann Wilhelm (1530-1573), attributed to Anton Pfeffenhauser with etched ornaments by Jörg Sorg, with parts of the large and complex garniture being stored in the Historic Museum Dresden and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, displays the more linear pattern. <br/>It was only after 1570 when he turned to a decorum of leaf and flower tendrils, as seen in the present design. In this armor from 1591 larger-than-life tendril ornaments decorate the front and the back piece of the armor, the elbow protectors and the shoulder elements as well as the gauntlets and are continued on the back of the helmet. The design seems to emphasize the overall unity of the armor."
