      "description": "The idea of a narration through a 3D model, in this case a historic garment from the textile collection at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum Nuremberg, arose from the desire to create a tool that enables a dynamic and fluid presentation of a 3D model and can also integrate a narration about the object. The project was implemented in a collaboration between the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History Luxembourg (C²DH) and the Urban Complexity Lab (UCLAB) at Potsdam University of Applied Sciences. As a guest researcher at UCLAB, Kirill Mitsurov (C²DH), together with Marian Dörk and Sabine de Günther (UCLAB), developed an interface for 3D stories that can be experienced by scrolling and that spotlights the relevant part of the object, while it can also , be freely explored. The resulting codes are reusable under the licence cc by 4.0. Credits: Daniele Guido (C²DH)."
