      "description": "Silk has been used for at least 5000 years. It is a natural fiber that can be produced by several insects: the most common one being the caterpillar.

      "title": "A luxurious Robe",
      "description": "This Robe à la française with a flower and lace pattern was clearly made for a festive occasion. It belongs to the category <em>parure</em> (clothing for festive events), as the cut, fabric and ornaments suggest. These were determining factors for the types of court garments –  <em>grande parure</em> (gala dress), <em>parure</em>, <em>négligé</em> (everyday dress) and <em>déshabillé</em> (indoor clothes) – at the end of the Ancien Régime."

      "description": "Over the long opening of the chest area a triangular, recessed bodice was originally worn. This bodice, which has not survived in the case of the blue dress, concealed the undergarment. It was attached to the dress neckline with pins.</br> Both the centre front and centre back are stabilized with whalebone stays and lacing at the back allowed it to be adjusted to fit the wearer. A long linen shirt and a separate laced bodice were worn under the dress and bodice."

      "description": "The sleeves were smoothly set in and covered the arm up to the elbow, where they ended in so-called wing cuffs (fr. <em>manchettes à raquette</em>), informally known as fin sleeves. Like the sleeves, they are lined with linen and additionally stiffened with paper in the cuffs. White lace cuffs peeked out from underneath, but these have not survived."

    {
      "title": "Woven ornaments",
      "description": "Floral ornaments, flowers and blossoms have in all times been central elements of textile ornamentation and patterning. They can be naturalistic, stylized, invented or prescinded. They can be woven into the fabric, printed or painted on the fabric. Floral elements can be realized via embroidery, via knitting, crochet and made in other textile techniques as lace-making. Here the filigree flower patterns are not embroidered but woven in."

      "title": "",
      "description": "18th century textiles reflect the taste of the time for gardens and individual flowers, such as roses. They were usually arranged loosely but symmetrically on the textile. The symbolic power of flowers played a major role in the occasion for which the dress was worn."
